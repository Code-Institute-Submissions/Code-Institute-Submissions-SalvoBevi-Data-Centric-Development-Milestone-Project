# Data Centric Development Milestone Project
# Zallo Giafferano

This Website has been developed for Code Institute's Data Centric Development Milestone Project and represents a recipe site. Is a multi-page site with which the User can interact to add, modify and delete cooking recipes.

## UX

This Project is to demonstrate lessons learned in this section Python Fundamentals and Data Centric Development.
The idea of the project is inspired by the various sites born on the web.
The realization was born to apply the notions learned in the Python fundamentals and Data Centric modules.

## Scenario

As mentioned above, I have created a basic website using, as much as I could, all the notions that I have received during this period. My aim is to continue building my website and develop, in particular, my projects page as that will be my business card for whoever would like to contact me and know more about my services and what I can, eventually, do for them.

## Features

The basic structure of the page is to allow the User a simple navigation.

* **Navbar**: Composed by on the webpage logo on the left corner and at the opposite end the communication buttons for the navigation links to various pages.

* **Mobile Sidenav**: Which shows the webpage logo at the top and under the communication buttons for the navigation links to various pages.

* **Section**: The body of the pages have been applied, where possible, the reuse of the codes according to the spirit of programming. Making navigation between sections homogeneous.

* **Register/Login/Logout**: User interaction begins with registration or via the login page providing Username and password. Once the actions have been completed on the web page, the User is able to use the logout button to disconnect from the session.

* **CRUD**: Within the web page the User is able Create, Read, Update, Delete the Cooking Recipes.

### Existing Features

The first function that the User can do is interact with the web page through the Home, where he has access to all the recipes loaded into the database. It is also possible to carry out a search using the search function.
The User can register, log in and log out of the web page through the links button provided.
The User is able to complete all requests for CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) the recipes. Furthermore, a limitation to this function has been added, only to the creators of the same recipes and to the admin page can have access to Edit and Delete functions.

### Features Left to Implement

In particular, for this project I would like to increase:
 - The functionality and the possibility for the User to manage the database of Ingredients through Python funciont, as was done for the add the recipes. 
 - To a calendar with meals of the day organized according to the dishes chosen by the User.
 - Update the security of the web page both by requesting a confermation email on registration and providing to the User a double confirmation while requesting to delete one or more recipes.
